# Pok√©mon Indigo League

This is an attempt to make my first pokemon rom hack. 
The idea is what if the Pokemon games were designed to be more like a traditional RPG in terms of difficulty 

Goals for Version 1.0
Make all 151 pokemon catchable- In progress
Adjust the HP Formula so a max bst, iv, and ev yields 999 max hp- Testing
Adjust the formula for the other 5 stats
Allow pokemon to gain a max of 255 EVs in each stat- Testing
Adjust the levels of wild pokemon to give the game a consistant challenge- In progress
Make all pure trade evolutions level evolutions- Testing
Make Feebas evolve by a way other than Beauty
Make held item trades evolve in a non-trade way
Adjust the type effectivness chart so that weakness and resistances make more sense (looking at you ICE)
Change the typings of some pokemon to either buff them or have them make more sense

Check the DETAILED CHANGES file for more info on what exactly has been changed

CHANGE LOG
7-12-2022
Some pokemon gender ratios modified
Kanto Trade Evolutions changed to level up evolutions
Some pokemon had types modified
Removed the 510 EV cap for pokemon. Now you can max out 255 EVs in all 6 stats
Vitamins will work on a pokemon until that stat has max EVs
Modified the HP stat formula for pokemon, now 255 base HP will yield a pokemon of 999 HP with max EVs and IVs
EV's now divide by 3 in both the stat formulas, making for an even 85 point increase at max 255 evs in a stat instead of 63.75 as before
