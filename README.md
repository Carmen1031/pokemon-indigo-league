# Pok√©mon Indigo League

This is an attempt to make my first pokemon rom hack. 
The idea is what if the Pokemon games were designed to be more like a traditional RPG in terms of difficulty 

Goals for Version 1.0
Make all 151 pokemon catchable- In progress
Adjust the HP Formula so a max level, bst, iv, and ev yields 999 max hp- COMPLETE
Adjust the formula for the other 5 stats to make combat actaully last more than 2 turns after early game
Allow pokemon to gain a max of 255 EVs in each stat- COMPLETE
Adjust the levels of wild pokemon to give the game a consistant challenge- In progress
Make all pure trade evolutions level evolutions- Testing
Adjust the type effectivness chart so that weakness and resistances make more sense (looking at you ICE)
Change the typings of some pokemon to either buff them or have them make more sense- In progress
Have the EV and IV values of the pokemon be viewable in the summary screen
Have the nature effects on stats be visible in the summary screen
Make Mt.  Ember accessable from outside Cinnabar Island because the just makes sense to me

Check the DETAILED CHANGES file for more info on what exactly has been changed
