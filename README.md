# Pok√©mon Indigo League

This is an attempt to make my first pokemon rom hack. 
The idea is what if the Pokemon games were made to be like a more traditional RPG. 

The game will have the following changes;
-All 151 pokemon will be catchable in the Kanto Area
-Trade evolutions will be changed to levels
-Encounter rates and tables will be edited for all 4 types of encounters
-Certain pokemon will have their types changed to either buff them or make more sense
-Type chart will be modifed slightly
-HM moves will be modified to be more useful in battle
-Moves in general will be edited
